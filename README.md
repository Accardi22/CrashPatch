# BetterCrashes

BetterCrashes is a port of VanillaFix's crash improvement features to Minecraft 1.7.10.

Most of the code comes from VanillaFix, I just make them work on Minecraft 1.7.10.

Requires [Grimoire](https://github.com/CrucibleMC/Grimoire) mod to work

## Known Issues

Not compatible with hodgepodge mod
